Hi, this is @GaoMX11.

I am currently an undergraduate student at Tsinghua University, Weiyang College, pursuing a double major in Fundamental Mathematics and Physics & Civil Engnieering and Systems. 

Additionally, due to interest in statistics, I am taking relevant courses as well.

An incoming 2025 fall PhD applicant.
